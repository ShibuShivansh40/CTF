Files can always be changed in a secret way. Can you find the flag? cat.jpg

Hint - 1 : Look at the details of the file

Hint - 2 : Make sure to submit the flag as picoCTF{XXXXX}

When you open the file in using : "nano cat.jpg"

In the resource id you will found something base64 encoded : "cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9"

Hence the conversion will give you : "picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}"
