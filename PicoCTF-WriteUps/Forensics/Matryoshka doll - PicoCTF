Hint - 1 : Wait, you can hide files inside files? But how do you find them?

Hint - 2 : Make sure to submit the flag as picoCTF{XXXXX}

The resources I checked, it can basically Steganography to hide a file inside an image.

It was a great to learn about the files that I can store inside a jpeg.

We just to need to unzip the jpeg multiple times. And you will find a flag.txt and it will show the following : 

p^@i^@c^@o^@C^@T^@F^@{^@b^@f^@6^@a^@c^@f^@8^@7^@8^@d^@c^@b^@d^@7^@5^@2^@f^@4^@7^@2^@1^@e^@4^@1^@b^@1^@b^@1^@b^@6^@>

It can be deocded simply as : picoCTF{bf6acf878dcbd752f4721e41b1b1b66b}
