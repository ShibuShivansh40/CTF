Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.

Hint - 1 : To view the file in the webshell, do: $ nano level1.py

Hint - 2 : To exit nano, press Ctrl and x and follow the on-screen prompts.

Hint - 3 : The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.

I just saw the Pytohn file and found the password that was to be entered on running the file.

Then just type in the password and you will get the flag.

The flag is : picoCTF{545h_r1ng1ng_56891419}
