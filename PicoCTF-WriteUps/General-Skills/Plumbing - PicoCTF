Description

Sometimes you need to handle process data outside of a file. Can you find a way to keep the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 7480.

Hint - 1 : Remember the flag format is picoCTF{XXXX}

Hint - 2 : What's a pipe? No not that kind of pipe... This kind

It was too simple to get the flag.

This is a CTF which provides multiple lines. So I just "grep" to get the flag.

The command I used was : nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 7480 | grep "pico"

The flag is : picoCTF{digital_plumb3r_06e9d954}
