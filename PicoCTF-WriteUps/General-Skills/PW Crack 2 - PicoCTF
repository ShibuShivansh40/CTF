Description

Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.

Hint - 1 : Does that encoding look familiar?

Hint - 2 : The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.

Now here when I opened the code, I found some ASCIIs codes to get the password. I used the Table of ASCII to get the values and the password was "4ec9".

Enter the password and you will get the flag as : picoCTF{tr45h_51ng1ng_9701e681}
