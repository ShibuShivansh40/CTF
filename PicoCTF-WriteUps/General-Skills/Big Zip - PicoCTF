Hint - 1 : Can grep be instructed to look at every file in a directory and its subdirectories?

I found the following commands on : https://seekfast.org/blog/search-text-in-documents/how-to-search-text-in-multiple-files-in-linux/

1. Make the search case-insensitive with the "-i" option:
grep -i 'searched-word' filename

 
2. Search recursively in all files in a given directory with the "-r" option:
grep -ir 'searched-word' '/directory'

 
3. Search whole words only with the "-w" option:
grep -irw 'searched-word' '/directory'

 
4. Print the line numbers in which the searched word was found with the "-n" option:
grep -irwn 'searched-word' '/directory'

 
5. Search for multiple words syntax:
grep -ir 'word1|word2|word3' '/directory'

But I used the following command to get the flag : "grep -R "pico" *"

And found the flag : picoCTF{gr3p_15_m4g1c_ef8790dc}
