I wrote you a song. Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

Hints - 1 : Do you think you can master rockstar?

As, you feel confused, I was also confused regarding that then I re-read the Hint and found that there si a programming language named "Rockstar".

You can find the resource file to it : "https://codewithrockstar.com/code"

Now we will try to find the way to crack it.

And then I installed the module for python, using the command : "pip install rockstar-py"

But on using the command "rockstar-py -i lyrics.txt -o <filename>.py" , I just got a python file, which didn't run, so basically I didn't get the idea of what I should do now?

Nothing happened, I executed many commands but then nothing happend, and same error for a string was pooping up.

So, I saw a write up and found that easiest way is to use the convertor : "https://codewithrockstar.com/online"

And paste the lyrics to it and get ASCII Code and then convert it to text.

And hence I got the answer as : "rrrocknrn0113r"

And then I just put that into the flag : picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
