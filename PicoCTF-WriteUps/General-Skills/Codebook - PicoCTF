Description

Run the Python script code.py in the same directory as codebook.txt.

    Download code.py
    Download codebook.txt

Hint - 1 : On the webshell, use ls to see if both files are in the directory you are in

Hint - 2 : The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.

Basically, "print_flag()" function takes the "codebook.txt" file as the input.

It was too simple to get , just use the command : "python code.py"

THe flag is : picoCTF{c0d3b00k_455157_7d102d7a}
