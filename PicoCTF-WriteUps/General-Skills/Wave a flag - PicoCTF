Description

Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? This program has extraordinarily helpful information...

Hint - 1 : This program will only work in the webshell or another Linux computer.

Hint - 2 : To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: $ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/fc1d77192c544314efece5dd309092e3/warm

Hint - 3 : Run this program by entering the following in the Terminal prompt: $ ./warm, but you'll first have to make it executable with $ chmod +x warm

Hint - 4 : -h and --help are the most common arguments to give to programs to get more information from them!

Hint - 5 : Not every program implements help features like -h and --help.

It was also an easy CTF, as you need to follow through the hints only. Just type in the command to downlaod the file first, using Hint 2. Then use the command : "chmod +x warm" to get the file in executable form and then run it using "./warm". Then use the "-h" param with it and boom you got your flag i.e. picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_6635aa47}
