Find the flag in the Python script! Download Python script

Hint - 1 : Try running the script and see what happens

Hint - 2 : In the webshell, try examining the script with a text editor like nano

Hint - 3 : To exit nano, press Ctrl and x and follow the on-screen prompts.

Hint - 4 : The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.

First, I tried to run the script then I found a output saying : "Oops! I must have misplaced the print_flag function! Check my source code!"

Then, I opened the python script, look what I found that the code had a function as "print_flag()" but it wasn't called, so I just added it to "choice == b".

Hence, I got the flag : picoCTF{7h3_r04d_l355_7r4v3l3d_aa2340b2}
