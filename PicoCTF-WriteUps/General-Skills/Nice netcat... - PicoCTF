There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: $ nc mercury.picoctf.net 49039, but it doesn't speak English...

Hint - 1 : You can practice using netcat with this picoGym problem: what's a netcat?

Hint - 2 : You can practice reading and writing ASCII with this picoGym problem: Let's Warm Up

It was an easy CTF, as you got everything in the hints only.

Just use the command given i.e. "nc mercury.picoctf.net 49039"

This will provide you with ASCII values, which can you furthur convert online to get the flag. 

And you got the flag as : picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_3d84edc8}
