Can you find the flag in file without running it?

Hint - 1 : strings

First, I checked the Manual page for the Strings.

I found it its working and it is as follows : "strings <file_name"

Then a list of strings appeared that were too large too read one by one. I just managed to read the string I want by using the grep command : "strings strings | grep picoCTF"

Then, I just found the flag : picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_827aee91}
