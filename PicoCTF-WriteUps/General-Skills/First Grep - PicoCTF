Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

Hint - 1 : grep tutorial

This basic approach was to first make the file executable, using the command : "chmod +x file".

Then, use the grep function and get the flag i.e. : picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_dba08a45}
