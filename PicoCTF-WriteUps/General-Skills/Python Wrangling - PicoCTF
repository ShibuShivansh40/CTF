Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run this Python script using this password to get the flag?\


Hint - 1 : Get the Python script accessible in your shell by entering the following command in the Terminal prompt: $ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/2ac2139344d2e734d5d638ac928f1a8d/ende.py

Hint - 2 : $ man python


I just used Hint 1 to download that file and now I will be checking the working of Python Script

This was to easy, just use the command : "python ende.py --help"

Now you will get a direct command to type to get the flag, then use : "python ende.py -d flag.txt.en"

And then you will see a response as : "Enter the password : "

Just type in what you got in your pw.txt file

And bang, you get your flag, i.e. : picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_68f88f93}
