Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too. There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

Hint - 1 : To view the level3.hash.bin file in the webshell, do: $ bvi level3.hash.bin

Hint - 2 : To exit bvi type :q and press enter.

Hint - 3 : The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.

I saw the code and found : 

pos_pw_list = ["f09e", "4dcf", "87ab", "dba8", "752e", "3961", "f159"]

I used every password and entered into the execution and got the flag : picoCTF{m45h_fl1ng1ng_cd6ed2eb}
