Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/


Hint - 1 : Maybe you have more than 2 choices
Hint - 2 : Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

There are two Options:
Red : This contains a form with a method as "GET"
Blue : This contains a form with a method as "POST"

Both the buttons cause a change in the colour

Basically when I use the "GET" method in the BurpSuite we get "Red Colour" and when we use "POST" method we get "Blue Color"

Try 1 :

<form enctype="multipart/form-data" id="myform" method="post" action="http://application.com/vulnerable_script.php" >
    <input type="hidden" name="argument" value="payload">
</form>
<script>document.myform.submit();</script>

Using this payload, might help. This can be used in the "POST" method.

This didn't work as no response was shown.

Try 2:

By changing the index.php to flag.php

Try 3:

I used anohter method of exploitation, I replace "GET" or "POST" with "PUT" the server got confused and showed me a question mark "?" instead of any name, but the response on browser was not very useful

Try 4:

I used another method of reuqest, "HEAD" as soon as I used it, the server gave me the flag i.e. picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_70bc61c4}
