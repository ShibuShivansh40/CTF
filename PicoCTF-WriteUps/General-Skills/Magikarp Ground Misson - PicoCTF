Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `6dee9772`

Hint - 1 : Finding a cheatsheet for bash would be really helpful!

Now first I have started the instance.

It basically asks us to use the ssh login by the command : "ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 60376"

Now enter the passworrd : ""

And then a remote shell has been opened in front of you.

Use the command "ls" and you get the first portion of flag, by using "cat 1of3.flag.txt" : picoCTF{xxsh_

And then find the instruction to find 2 of 3 and now you need to go to the root and you will find the flag as "2of3.flag.txt" : 0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_

And in the similar way you can find the third flag with the help of file "instructions-to-3of3.txt" : 540e4e79}

And hence the flag is : picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_540e4e79}
