If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII? 

Hint - 1 : Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

It just required a conversion from Hex "0x70" to ASCII which was "p".

Hence the flag becomes : picoCTF{p}
