Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)? 

Hint - 1 : Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

42 = 32 + 8 + 2
   = 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^1
   = 101010

Hence the flag is : picoCTF{101010}
