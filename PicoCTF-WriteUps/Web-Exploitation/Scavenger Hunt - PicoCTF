There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/. Can you find it?

Hint 1 : You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

Hey, I used the previous approach and found something in HTML : <!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t  --> 

Try 1:

I will use the same approach now, like finding the CSS files and JS files and see the working of the website

In the JS File I found something : /* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */

This is what I found from Google about ther indexing part : You can prevent a page or other resource from appearing in Google Search by including a noindex meta tag or header in the HTTP response. When Googlebot next crawls that page and sees the tag or header, Google will drop that page entirely from Google Search results, regardless of whether other sites link to it.\

Now I will try to use BurpSuite to check the response and request.

But still I using the previous approach helped me, I found something in CSS File : /* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */

Here I wasn't able to solve the CTF. So I switched any other CTF.

///////////Try /robots.txt file & admin files too
