Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511

Hint 1 : How do you inspect web code on a browser?

Hint 2 : There's 3 parts


Look what I found while understanding the HTML : <!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->

Look what I found while looking to Java file "myjs.js" : /* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?832b0699} */


Try 1 :

I saw a randome cookies parameter in the JS response names "_cf_bm" and I tried to crack using CrackStation but nothing found.

Try 2 :

And finally I found /* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */

Not the flag is : picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}

This was easy though because of hints and also due to the information provided by the Website's content.
